Description: MACS (model based analysis for ChIP-Seq) is a popular program for
    converting ChIP-Seq reads into peaks. If produces a number of output files
    in a directory, which to my mind can be improved a little. This package
    imports these results, can improve the result files, and can annotate peaks
    with their nearest TSS and CpG island.
