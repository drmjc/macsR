\title{Lookup keys in a chain of 2 environment or AnnDbBimap objects
Sometimes you need to chain (or JOIN) a few mapping tables together
in order to get the end result.
For example, Using the annotation.db packages, if you need to go from
GENESYMBOL to GENENAME, you have to go via the ENTREZGENE ID.
You would lookup the entrez gene ID for
each SYMBOL, using the org.Hs.egSYMBOL2EG AnnDbBimap,
which can sometimes return \code{NA}'s. Then take
those Entrez Gene ID's and look them up in the org.Hs.egGENENAME
table. This function does the hard work for you.}
\usage{
  mget.chain(keys, a, b, debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{keys}{a vector of search keys which must be found
  in a}

  \item{a}{an environment, or AnnDbBimap object}

  \item{b}{an environment, or AnnDbBimap object}

  \item{debug}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, then a 3 column
  \code{data.frame} is returned, containing the keys,
  intermediate result, then final value. If \code{FALSE},
  the default, return a named vector of values}
}
\value{
  For the N search keys, either return a named vector, of
  length N of mapped values, or a 3 column, N row
  \code{data.frame}, if \code{debug=TRUE}. if there is no
  mapped value for a key, \code{NA} is returned.

\note{
  this returns only the first match for each key, along
  each of the mapping steps, where \dQuote{first} is
  defined in \code{\link{mget2}}.
